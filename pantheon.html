<h1 id= "olympians">The Olympians</h1>
<h3>Zeus</h3>

    <p> The deity of the sky, the weather, law and order, fate and destiny, and monarchy, Zeus was known as the King of the Gods. He was portrayed as a solidly built, regal, mature man sporting a thick beard. His standard attributes were an eagle, a royal sceptre, and a lightning bolt.
      </p>
    <p>As the youngest of the Titans Kronos (Cronus) and Rheia, Zeus was called Zeus. Zeus avoided this fate when his mother whisked him away, giving the Titan a stone substitute wrapped in swaddling blankets, while Kronos devoured each of his newborns.
      </p>
    <p>The deity was secretly nurtured on Mount Dikte in Krete (Crete), where he was fed by nymphs on the milk of the goat Amaltheia and protected by the warrior Kouretes (Curetes), whose shield-waving battle dance muffled the sound of the god's cries.
      </p>
    <p>Zeus enlisted the goddess Metis in his cause when he reached adulthood. She provided the Titan Kronos with a sorcerous drink that made him vomit the young gods he had eaten.
      </p>
    <p>From Tartaros' abyss, Zeus freed the six giant-sons of Heaven. As a token of appreciation, the Hekatonkheires (Hundred-Handed) provided him with lightning-bolts, while the Kyklopes (Cyclopes) supported him with boulder volleys to help him take on the Titanes. Ultimately, Kronos and his allies were vanquished and sent to an underground jail.
      </p>
    <p>Zeus and his brothers cast lots to choose who would control the universe after the fall of the Titan gods. Zeus won the heavens, Poseidon the sea, and Haides the underworld.
      </p>
    <p>When an oracle foretold that Metis's son would succeed him as King of the Gods, Zeus devoured the pregnant goddess. After that, Athena, their child, was born right out of his skull and into his belly.
      </p>
    <p>Zeus married his sister Hera, ruler of the skies, after wooing her in the guise of a cuckoo-bird. However, it turned out that this union of the always arguing sky-god and sky-goddess was not meant to be!
      </p>
    <p>Mankind was created by Prometheus, who also gave them fire that had been taken from the gods of heaven. Zeus ordered the birth of the first woman, Pandora, as retribution for this deed, and he sent her to Earth with a vessel full of problems to afflict humanity. An eagle was assigned to punish Prometheus, who was captured and bound to a mountain.
      </p>
    <p>Zeus made the decision to exterminate the first human generations off the face of the planet by a massive deluge due to their descent into evil and depravity. Deukalion and Pyrrha, a good couple, were spared and later permitted to repopulate the earth by casting stones that turned into men.
      </p>
    <p>Enraged at the Titanes' confinement, the earth goddess Gaia (Gaea) called for the Giants to rebel against the Olympos gods. They besieged the celestial stronghold, but Zeus' lethal lightning-bolts destroyed their ruler and numerous more.
      </p>
    <p>Typhoeus, the most terrifying giant of his kind, was created by Gaia and placed atop Mount Olympos. The other gods scurried away in terror, and Zeus himself lost the fight when the monster tore the sinews from his limbs, making him immobile. Subsequently, Zeus vanquished the giant in a rematch after Pan stole his strength back, and Zeus confined the behemoth beneath Mount Etna.
      </p>
    <p>Zeus enticed numerous mortal women, such as Antiope in the form of a satyr, Kallisto (Callisto) as the goddess Artemis, Danae as a shower of gold, Leda as a swan, and Europa as a bull.
      </p>
    <p>Herakles, also known as Heracles, was the deity's favorite mortal son, supporting him through his tribulations and ultimately welcoming him to Olympos as a god.
      </p>
    <p>For their impiety and transgressions against the gods, Zeus punished the most notorious villains in mythology, such as Tantalos for stealing ambrosia from heaven, Lykaon (also known as Lycaon) for feeding the gods human flesh, Ixion for attempting to rape Zeus' wife, the goddess Hera, and Salmoneus for attempting to pretend to be Zeus and stealing the worship that was rightfully theirs.
      </p>

      <h3>Hera</h3>

      <p> Hera served as the reigning queen among the Olympian gods, overseeing domains such as marriage, women, the sky, and celestial bodies. Artists often portrayed her as an elegant figure adorned with a crown, wielding a regal scepter adorned with a lotus, and occasionally accompanied by a lion, cuckoo, or hawk.
        </p>
      <p>Some of the more renowned myths featuring Hera include:
        </p>
      <p>1. Marriage to Zeus: She married Zeus, who, in a cunning disguise, seduced her in the form of a cuckoo bird.
        </p>
      <p>The Russian Diamond Fund was one of Kunz's copies, and inside it, researchers found four jewelry items that had never been published before. A sapphire bow brooch, an emerald and diamond necklace, a sapphire and diamond bracelet, and The Sapphire Wave Tiara. The tiara included nine seemingly impossibly huge sapphires that were encircled by wave-like diamond loops that each ended in diamond drops. It was so peculiar that some may even argue the tiara had an oceanic feel to it. The tiara was recognized as having belonged to Marie Feodorovna, who you may recall as Alexander III's wife and the mother of the last Tzar of Russia, in a drawing in Geoffrey Munn's book Tiaras: A History of Splendor.
        </p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Maria Feodorovna wearing the Sapphire Wave Tiara in the Kokoshnik style.</figcaption>
          </figure>
      <p>The tiara was commonly worn backed by a traditional kokoshnik headpiece covered in cloth and capped with a row of diamonds (possibly from a diamond rivière necklace). The painting to the right depicts an example of how the Tiara was worn by the Russian Imperial family. In addition to appearing in Konstantin Makovsky's photograph, Marie wore the tiara to the wedding of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia in 1874. However, it remains a mystery as to where the tiara might be right now. The USGS research team was able to ascertain that the tiara and other diamonds, excluding the brooch, were lost to history after being sold at auction in 1927. They could have been disassembled, sold, and used to make other pieces by the Bolsheviks a long time ago.

  <h3>Persephone</h3>
    <p> The Russian word "kokoshnik" is translated. In the past, it was used to describe a headgear worn by married Russian women in specific regions of the nation. The size and shape of these classic kokoshniks varied slightly. Some of them were enormous, as seen in the image on the left, while others were smaller. However, kokoshniks generally had the same fundamental crescent shape. Many of them had ribbons fastening them at the back of the head.
      </p>
    <p>When the Romanov court started donning kokoshniks in the nineteenth century, they quickly gained popularity in the world of royal jewelry. To go with these classic Russian hat shapes, Russian tsarinas and grand duchesses copied the European tiara fashion, which had been popular at Napoleon's court in France. The huge kokoshnik headdresses that were a common feature of the traditional attire of many Russian peasants were typically transformed into smaller, crescent-shaped headdresses that resembled halos under the control of the Romanovs.
      </p>
    <p> The Romanovs added jewels to their kokoshniks, sometimes giving tiaras firm fabric backings to give them the necessary shape, and other times having tiaras fashioned in the same style as kokoshniks so that no additional fabric was required. You can see how a row of pearls was attached to a diamond fringe tiara worn by Tsarina Maria Feodorovna in the detail of the photo at the top of this piece to resemble the crescent form of kokoshniks. Like the four daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, unmarried Russian grand duchesses typically wore plain fabric kokoshniks without significant gems, though pearls were occasionally added.  Many grand duchesses added veils to their kokoshniks when they wore court attire.
      </p>
    <p>Due in part to the Romanovs' many familial connections to other royal houses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the kokoshnik-style tiara gained popularity across Europe. Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom asked for a tiara modeled after one of Tsarina Maria Feodorovna's kokoshniks as an anniversary present in 1888. Her great-granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, still dons the same diamond-set white and yellow gold kokoshnik tiara [4]. Other royal and noble families also possess kokoshnik tiaras that were modeled after those worn at the Romanov imperial court, such as the Bernadottes in Sweden and the Rosenborgs in Denmark.
      </p>
    <p>Because so many grand duchesses wed into different royal families, many examples of kokoshnik-shaped tiaras can still be found in European tiara collections today. Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, afterwards known as Queen Olga of the Hellenes, sent an emerald-studded kokoshnik to her new nation (see picture at right). The tiara has undergone changes throughout the years, but its current design still resembles its original kokoshnik design. As part of their wedding trousseaux, many Russian grand duchesses received diamond fringe tiaras that resembled kokoshnik headdresses. You can still see some of these tiaras on the descendants of these grand duchesses today in nations like Germany and Denmark (which they inherited from two Romanov duchesses, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna). Because of its ties to the Romanovs, these fringe tiaras with halo-like adornments have also been referred to as tiaras russe.
      </p>
    <p>Other royals frequently bought kokoshnik tiaras from the Romanovs after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The spectacular Cartier sapphire and diamond kokoshnik tiara that Queen Marie of Romania purchased from her aunt, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna ("the Elder") of Russia, was owned by the Romanian royal family until Princess Ileana, Queen Marie's daughter, sold it in exile in the 1950s. Originally made for Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a member of the Romanov family who was assassinated by the Bolsheviks, and sold to the Yugoslavian king by her niece, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna ("the Younger"), Alexander I of Yugoslavia purchased the diamond and emerald kokoshnik for his new wife, Princess Maria of Romania, in 1922.
      </p>
    <p>So, ask yourself a few straightforward questions if you want to simply identify a kokoshnik tiara today. Is it in the form of a half-moon or a halo? Is the top of it noticeably curved? Is it connected to Russia or was it influenced by Russia? Any "yes" responses to any of those inquiries indicate that you are most certainly looking at a kokoshnik.

      <h3>The Imperial Crown of Russia</h3>
        <p>The Russian monarchs' use of the Imperial Crown of Russia, often known as the Great Imperial Crown, lasted from 1762 until the end of the Russian monarchy in 1917. The great imperial crown was originally worn during Catherine the Great's coronation and was last seen at Nicholas II's. It was widely presented at the State Opening of the Russian Duma in the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1906, sitting next to Nicholas II on a cushion. It is currently on exhibit in Moscow in the State Diamond Fund of the Kremlin Armory after surviving the 1917 revolution.
          </p>
        <p>The large imperial crown was created by court jewelers Ekart and Jérémie Pauzié in 1762 for Catherine the Great's coronation. The stunning crown is evidence of Pauzié's exceptional craftsmanship. 4936 diamonds total, 4936 of which are set in beautiful patterns, cover the full surface of the crown. The "mitre"'s margins are framed by a number of exquisite, substantial white pearls. The Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678, Nicholas Spafary, brought back to Russia a magnificent precious red spinel measuring 398.72 carats (79.744 g), which is one of the seven historical stones in the Russian Diamond Collection. The second-largest spinel in the world is thought to be this one.
          </p>
        <p>When Peter the Great formally adopted the term "Emperor" for the head of Russia, he also adopted Western imperial symbols. Among these were the design of the private crowns (Hauskrone) worn by Holy Roman Emperors (of which the only surviving example is the Austrian imperial crown of Rudolf II, the Imperial Crown of Austria), which features a mitre with a high arch extending from the front to the back fleur-de-lis. The two parts of the mitre were changed into two half-spheres in some baroque depictions of this type of imperial crown that were found on saint sculptures in Austria as well as in Russia. This style of imperial crown was first worn by Catherine I, Peter's widow and successor.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/imperialcrown.jpeg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="russimperialcrown" style="float:right;width:330px;height:400px;">
          </p>
        <p> These hemispheres are in open metalwork resembling basketwork in the grand imperial crown that the court jewelers Pauzié and J. F. Loubierin created for Catherine II in 1762. The edges of both hemispheres are bordered by a row of 37 exceptionally fine, large, white pearls. They are supported by a circlet of 19 diamonds, the greatest of which is the huge Indian pear-shaped stone in front that weighs 1258 carats and is placed between two bands of diamonds above and below. All 19 diamonds average over 5 carats (1.0 g) in weight. By replacing the eight fleur-de-lis with four pairs of crossed palm branches, Posier demonstrated his inventive genius. The curve between these matches is comprised of little jewels of oak leaves and oak seeds encompassing various huge precious stones of shifting shapes and colors [8] running from the front sets of crossed palms to the back sets of crossed palms. One of the seven historic stones in the Russian Diamond Collection, this large red spinel weighing 398.72 carats (79.744 grams) was brought to Russia by Nicholas Spafary, the Russian envoy to China from 1675 to 1678. Two strips of similar oak leaves and acorns from the two side pairs divide the basketwork pattern of the two hemispheres. It can be found at the central arch's apex and center. It is believed to be the world's second-largest spinel[9]. The Christian faith of the sovereign, the monarchy's God-given power, and the divine order's dominance over earthly power are all represented by the five-diamond cross atop this spinel. It was incomplete in time for Catherine's royal celebration, and the first shaded stones (e.g., emeralds in the palm branches and shrub leaves) were supplanted with precious stones for Paul I's royal celebration in 1797. Apart from the two columns of enormous white pearls, the entire surface of the crown is covered with 4936 jewels.[10] In contrast, the Crown of Monomakh only weighs two pounds. It was used at every subsequent crowning liturgy until Nicholas II's in 1896, and it was used at the State Opening of the Duma in 1906 in a majestic way.
          </p>

        <h3>The Lesser Imperial Crown of Russia </h3>
        <p>A lesser imperial crown was also made for Empress Maria Feodorovna, the consort of Paul I, and used for the Tsarina's coronation.
        </p>
        <p><img src="rimages2/lesser.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="lessimperialcrown" style="float:left;width:240px;height:220px;">
        </p>
          <p>It was smaller and entirely set with diamonds, and it was very similar to the great imperial crown in style and craftsmanship. At the royal celebration of Nicholas II in 1896, the more modest crown was worn by Matron Sovereign Maria Feodorovna, similar to one side as a delegated Ruler. The young Empress Alexandra Feodorovna was given a second, identical lesser imperial crown to wear. At the Russian Court, dowager Empresses ranked higher than reigning Empress Consorts.
          </p>
        <p>In 1900, the studio of Peter Carl Fabergé in St. Petersburg made a reproduction in little of the supreme formal attire (the extraordinary magnificent crown, the lesser majestic crown, the royal circle and staff) out of silver, gold, jewels, sapphires, and rubies, the entire set on a marble platform. The work is now in the Hermitage Museum's collection.
          </p>

        <br>


      <h3> The Vladimir Sapphire Kokoshnik</h3>
        <p>The royal gift that just kept on giving in the years following the Russian Revolution was the gem collection of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (the Elder) of Russia, also known as Grand Duchess Vladimir. However, this sapphire kokoshnik was the tiara that MP the Elder used to buy her way out of Russia as many of her family members were being murdered by the Bolsheviks, despite the fact that some of her tiaras, including the famous Vladimir Tiara, were sold off after the family had gone into exile. The buyers were members of the Romanian royal family, not merely jewel collectors.
          </p>
        <p>Briefly stated, during World War I, when the political climate in Romania became unstable, the jewels of Queen Marie of Romania were moved to Moscow for security, along with a staggering amount of other treasures and assets from the nation. Marie had close ties to the Romanov family through her mother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, who wed Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), the son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Members of the grand ducal family of Hesse sent their jewels to Russia in the same manner as Marie, believing that they would be secure there. (The tsarina was born a Hessian princess, after all.)
          </p>
        <p><img src="rimages/vladsaph.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="vladsaphtiara" style="float:right;width:425px;height:350px;">
        </p>
        <p>And that's when things took a bad turn. Everyone is aware of what happened to the Romanovs after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The Romanian royal jewels were also at danger due to the Russian government's transition of power. The Soviet Union severed all diplomatic links, the Romanians invaded Russian-held territory, and the riches were left stranded. Over time, some of the priceless items have been returned, but many of them, including Marie's jewels, have never been brought back to Romania. Marie was obviously devastated to lose her jewelry, especially because many of them were gifts from her Russian mother. Her diamond loop tiara, gorgeous Massin tiara that had been passed down through the family for generations, and the tiara she had gotten as a wedding gift from her parents were all gone. ​
          </p>
        <p>King Ferdinand, the husband of Marie, granted his wife the necessary funds to replenish her collection by buying new diamonds to replace the ones that had been lost. Marie, however, was exempt from the need to visit a jewelry shop in order to purchase a new tiara. Instead, she only needed to look in her aunt’s, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna (also known as Grand Duchess Vladimir), collection to find a new diadem. This sapphire and diamond kokoshnik tiara, created by Cartier in 1909, was the one she bought. A brooch had previously held the largest center sapphire, a cushion-cut rock weighing more than 137 carats. The other sapphires, which were smaller cabochons, were Romanov treasures from the nineteenth century; Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, the wife of Tsar Nicholas I, had originally owned them.
          </p>
        <p>The tiara was one of the more ostentatious items in the genuinely amazing Vladimir gem collection, but when the revolution took place, it was more important to leave Russia than to keep the diadem. In 1917, Maria Pavlovna sold the tiara to her niece, the Romanian queen. Marie of Romania used the tiara as the centerpiece of her replacement collection, while Maria Pavlovna used the money to purchase her escape from Russia into exile. Later, her husband bought a stunning sapphire pendant from Cartier to go with it.
          </p>
        <p>Queen Marie made it clear that the tiara she wore when she was painted by Philip de László was a significant piece of her new collection. She frequently incorporated the tiara into the dramatic royal images she so adored. But eventually she made the decision to pass it on to the following generation. When Princess Ileana wed an Austrian archduke in 1931, she gave the tiara to her daughter. Ileana really returned the tiara to her mother four years later so she could wear it during King George V of the United Kingdom's Silver Jubilee. Marie kept the tiara in her London bank for safekeeping at that time since political unrest was already severe in Romania; she was undoubtedly conscious of what had happened to her bridal jewelry. Only shortly before the start of World War II was Ileana able to reclaim the tiara.
          </p>
        <p>The monarchy of Romania was essentially abolished after the war. In 1947, the youthful King Michael I was compelled to resign, and the royal family fled to exile. Ileana eventually made it to the US, and at first, she brought the sapphire tiara with her. The princess's book contains intriguing accounts of the tiara and her travels throughout the world wearing it. However, she ultimately made the decision to part with the object as well. She sold the tiara back to its original manufacturer, Cartier, in the early 1950s. She used the money she was given to more useful uses, including making a down payment on a new house and paying the airfare she needed to bring her kids to America. Sadly, Cartier reportedly decided to completely disassemble the tiara. A grand Romanov object and valuable piece of history has been lost to time.

      <h3>The Koch Aquamarine Kokoshnik</h3>
        <p>This striking diamond and aquamarine tiara was originally part of the Imperial Russian  jewelry collection. There do not appear to be any photographs  of the Romanovs actually wearing the tiara, and the provenance of the piece is somewhat obscure. It has often been speculated over the years that the Tiara dates from around 1900 and may have been made by Fabergé. (Since the company often supplied jewelry to the Romanovs, this was not an unreasonable possibility.)
          </p>
        <p>However, it was recently revealed that the Tiara was actually made in Germany around 1910. The makers were the fabulous and innovative jewelers of Kochi. They are responsible for some of the most balanced and classic royal kokoshniks, including the Prussian Tiara and the Prussian Meander Kokoshnik, so it makes a lot of sense that they are also revealed as the makers of this kokoshnik. The tiara features diamonds and rectangular aquamarines that perfectly utilize the natural shape of the platinum and gold-plated gems. Sometimes a tiara is seen next to a pair of earrings and a necklace; these were later creations not made by Koch and not part of any of the original parades.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/aqua.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="russaquatiara" style="float:left;width:300px;height:200px;">
          </p>
        <p>It’s long been said that the aquamarine kokoshnik came from the personal jewelry collection of Alexandra Feodorovna, the last Empress of Russia. She loved aquamarines, and her husband, Nicholas II, loved giving them to her. One of his engagement presents to her, after all, was a fantastic aquamarine brooch. But, as I said, we have no images of Alexandra wearing the tiara, and we don’t know exactly what would have happened to the tiara after the family was toppled from the throne. While many of the former imperial jewels were meticulously catalogued and photographed by the Soviets in preparation for public auction, the aquamarine tiara was not among them.
          </p>
        <p>However, there are many rumors about where Tiara went next. Some have suggested that Wartski, a London-based jeweler specializing in Russian gems, acquired the aquamarine in Russia about two years after the Romanov assassination. Others claimed that representatives of the Soviet government brought the tiara to Paris in a suitcase and sold it there. What we do know for sure is that Sotheby's put the tiara (or a very similar piece) up for auction in Switzerland in the 1980s. It was later sold privately by Christie's in 2014. And in December 2017, Christie's again offered the tiara (or a very similar piece) at a special private tiara sale in London, calling it simply an "antique aquamarine and diamond tiara" and mentioning no imperial connection.

        <p>  Ladonia is a microstate: an entity whose members claim to belong to an independent sovereign state, but which is not officially recognized by world governments or institutions. ("Microstate" is different from "microstate" - for example Liechtenstein or Monaco. The rest of the world recognizes these small countries as sovereign territories.) Ladonia is physically a small country in Sweden. a warehouse that surrounds the sculptures of Lars Vilks; he declared the area surrounding the sculptures a sovereign state in 1996 in a dispute with the local council. Ladonia has citizens but no residents, including  Queen Carolyn, who was born in America and still lives there with her husband and children.
          </p>
        <p>Although Tiara has been in the shadows for quite some time, we recently learned that she has found a permanent new home. It was purchased by Japan's Albion Institute of Art, whose president, Kazumi Arikawa, is the curator of one of the world's largest privately owned collections of historic gems. Arikawa's ultimate goal is to build a large museum in Kyoto to house these works, but currently the institute often lends its tiaras and jewels to exhibitions around the world.

        <h3>Alexandra Feodorovna’s Pearl & Diamond Diadem</h3>
        <p><img src="rimages/pearldiadem.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="dia and pearl tiara" style="float:right;width:220px;height:200px;">
          </p>
        <p> The tiara - which seems to be an apt description of a headpiece that is really too large to be described as a tiara - is of somewhat uncertain origin. We know it was in Alexandra's collection before 1906, but historians don't seem to agree on the details of its creation. A.E. Fersman, who compiled the famous catalog of Romanov jewels after the revolution, listed the tiara as a 19th-century piece of jewelry; she reportedly believed that the tiara was the most impressive piece of jewelry in the entire collection. In his book Romanov Jewels, Stefano Papi disputes the date of Fersman's creation, claiming that the tiara was "made especially for the empress by the court jeweler Bolin" but contains "ancient pearls and diamonds from the Imperial Collection".
          </p>
        <p>We know that the impressive diamond and pearl was in Alexandra's collection in the spring of 1906.  In May 1906, he wore the diadem at the official opening of the first Duma in St. Petersburg. A Times correspondent  was on hand to witness the unveiling. He described the dress of the two women as follows: "The young Empress was in white and gold, and the Empress Marie in white trimmed with black sable."
          </p>
        <p> So what happened to Alexandra's pearl and diamond tiara? Unfortunately, I think you can guess. The tiara was confiscated by the Bolsheviks during the revolution and is easy to spot in the famous inventory photo where the jewels are placed on a large table. Since 1922 there has been no public sign of the tiara. Almost a century later, I think it's safe to say it's been lost to history.
          </p>

        <h3>Elizabeth Alexeievna's Diamond Kokoshnik</h3>
        <p>Young Princess Louise of Baden was set up with Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich of Russia, the future Tsar Alexander I, by Catherine the Great, the matchmaker of matchmakers. And of course the granddaughter-in-law of a strong royal woman, who would later be known as Elizabeth Alexeievna, would have magnificent jewels. I believe it is safe to declare that Diamond Kokoshnik by Elizabeth Alexeievna meets the criteria.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/diakoko.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="dia kokoshnik" style="float:left;width:300px;height:200px;">
              </p>
        <p>She was picked to wed into a royal family by a strong woman in order to maintain a continued geographic tie. She renounced her previous name and adopted Elizabeth Alexeievna. She renounced her previous faith and became a member of the Russian Orthodox church.
          </p>
        <p>Elizabeth's early 1800s diamond tiara continued to exist. A very huge round diamond is in the middle of two rows of large pear-shaped stones, which are separated by a band of smaller diamonds and below tightly held rays of diamonds that shine upward. Pear-shaped stones on the bottommost row were "en Tremblant" and must have gleamed in the candlelight like little disco balls. The precious stones are set in both gold and silver. The tiara was pictured on the head of Alexandra Feodorovna, the wife of Nicholas II, nearly a century after Elizabeth would have been the last to wear it. It was then taken by the Bolsheviks and displayed before disappearing permanently. How did Elizabeth Alexeievna's Diamond Kokoshnik turn out? It’s current origins are up for speculation but it can be assumed that it might have been dismantled and sold off in pieces.
          </p>

        <h3>Alexandra Feodorovna's Emerald Tiara</h3>
        <p>The tragic Romanovs' court has become the stuff of folklore and history in the nearly century after their passing, and the diamonds worn by the Romanova women have attracted a great deal of interest. Today's topic is an emerald tiara made for Alexandra Feodorovna, the nation's last empress.
          </p>
        <p> The emerald and diamond tiara was a piece of a bigger parure that Alix had purchased from Bolin and Faberge, two renowned Russian jewelers, in 1900. Oscar Piel, a jeweler for Fabergé, constructed a sizable matching devant-de-corsage, and Sophia Schwan, a jeweler for Bolin, made the parure's tiara and necklace. Due to its ability to create a complete circle, the tiara is also occasionally referred to as a "coronet" or "circlet." The tiara and necklace were "made in great haste" by Schwan, according to Stefano Papi in Jewels of the Romanovs, but he does not say why.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/emtiara.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="emerald tiara" style="float:right;width:300px;height:220px;">
              </p>
        <p>Although some sources claim that the large emeralds used came from Colombian mines, the tiara's diamonds were sourced from South Africa. (For this reason, you may occasionally hear this referred to as the "Colombian tiara"). The emerald set in the center of the circlet is the largest; according to Papi, it is a "quadrangular sugarloaf cabochon emerald" that weighs about "23 carats." With flower accents positioned in the center of each scroll, the tiara features alternating ribbon and scroll motifs. The necklace also has ribbon and scroll patterns.
          </p>
        <p>In 1907, Nikolai Bodarevsky painted Alix wearing the tiara and devant-de-corsage from the parure. Although the tsarina may only be seen in this portrait sporting items from her emerald parure, we do know a little bit more about the circlet us ultimate fate.
          </p>
        <p>Sadly, the tiara and the necklace can be seen among the objects in the iconic Soviet "table" inventory depiction from 1922.  The majority of the diamonds on the table were either broken up or sold at auction. Since A.E. Fersman photographed and inventoried the emeralds in the mid-1920s, they have not been seen in public. It would be great to think that they are stashed away in a private collection, lurking somewhere in the shadows. Unfortunately, it’s more likely that it was dismantled.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Pink Diamond Diadem</h3>
        <p> Designed by St. Petersburg jeweler Jacob David Duval for either Elizabeth Alexeievna (Princess Louise of Baden, 1779-1826), the wife of Tsar Alexander I, or Maria Feodorovna (Duchess Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg, 1759-1828). Whoever it was intended for, it is amazing that considering its age, it is still presentable and essentially unmodified.
          </p>
        <p>The magnificent natural pink diamond, a 13.335 carat stone with more than 1,000 carats of diamonds surrounding it, is the focal point of the towering kokoshnik design. The stone was once foil-backed, which explains the variation in hue from image to image. The briolette-cut diamonds in the tiara's center are "en Tremblant," which means they are free to move, dangle, and toss prisms worthy of a disco ball around with each motion.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/pdiakoko.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="pink dia kokoshnik" style="float:left;width:300px;height:220px;">
              </p>
        <p> It is the only authentic diadem that has survived the revolution and is still in Russia. Over 1,200 small round cut diamonds and 175 large Indian diamonds totaling a triangular headband in the Empire style. Large diamonds in the shape of a tear are suspended freely in the middle row and shine brilliantly with every head movement. Due to the extraordinary pink diamond, experts value this work of art as being priceless. Empress Maria Feodorovna wore the pink diamond tiara during her wedding, and afterwards, other brides from the royal dynasty also wore it.
          </p>
        <p>Given that it has the term "Russian Nuptial Tiara," it should be clear that the bride frequently wore it during royal marriages in Russia (along with a plethora of other imperial wedding jewels, including the wedding crown, because evidently one headpiece was insufficient). When Alexandra Feodorovna married Nicholas II in 1894, she was one of the last people to wear it (but not THE absolute last). The royal jewels were taken by the Bolsheviks after the assassination of the royal family in July 1918 and were collectively displayed in 1922. After that, many of the pieces were sold to affluent Americans and Europeans (more on that later). Some just vanished (like the wedding necklace made of diamonds). Additionally, some were kept by the Russian government and are secured in the Diamond Fund Museum at the Moscow Kremlin. And that is where the Russian Nuptial Tiara is currently located; it has been hidden there for almost a century.
          </p>

        <h3>The Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik</h3>
        <p> One of the magnificent Romanov artifacts that was taken into custody was the Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik Tiara. However, we can follow a paper trail that indicates where it ended up. At least for a time. However, let us go back to the beginning.
          </p>
        <p>Bolin made the tiara in 1841 for Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Nicolas I's wife, out of 25 of the finest pearls suspended from diamond arches. But the tiara was truly cherished by Marie Feodorovna, Tsar Alexander III's wife. So much so that she retained it in her home even though it was a piece of the Crown Jewels and not her personal tiara. In order to escape the eventual fate of her son and family (it is good to have family in high positions), Marie, by this point the Dowager Empress, fled to the Crimea during the Bolshevik revolution. King George V, her nephew, sent a ship to fetch her.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/pearlpend.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="pearl pend koko" style="float:left;width:250px;height:160px;">
              </p>
        <p> She had only her "day jewels" with her when she first escaped because she had no notion that she would never come back. When Prince Felix Yusupov (you may recall him as one of the assassins who killed Rasputin) went to her house to get the remainder of her jewelry collection, he discovered that they were already gone. The Bolsheviks had gained possession of it.
          </p>
        <p>Contrary to many of the others, however (such as the Sapphire Wave Tiara, the Yugoslavian Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara, and Elizabeth Alexeievna's Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara), we can trace this tiara back to a Christie's auction in 1927 when it was purchased by jeweler Holmes & Co., who then sold it to the 9th Duke of Marlborough to give to his second wife Gladys.
          </p>
        <p> When Gladys passed away, the tiara changed hands once more in 1978, making its way through the London jewelry trade before ending up in Imelda Marcos' collection. The tiara still rests in a vault at the Central Bank of the Philippines with countless other jewels that were purportedly bought with money from the Philippine government, awaiting their ultimate fate.
          </p>
        <p>There have been rumors that the Philippine government will either exhibit the seized items, including The Russian Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik Tiara, to boost tourism or will auction them off.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Yugoslavian Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara</h3>
        <p> First cousin to King Alexander, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, wed Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark in 1923. Given that Olga was related to almost all of the significant royal families in Europe, this marriage was especially advantageous for Yugoslavia. Her mother was Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, the daughter of the formidable and jewel-obsessed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, the Grand Duchess Vladimir. Her father was Prince Nicolas of Greece.
          </p>
        <p>Elena had received the customary jewel-encrusted bridal gifts fit for an Imperial Russian Grand Duchess, including this rumored Cartier-made Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara. On the occasion of her daughter Olga's wedding, she in turn gave her this tiara.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/yugo.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt= "yugo" style="float:right;width:300px;height:220px;">
              </p>
        <p> Tragically, Prince Paul took over as regent of Yugoslavia after King Alexander was killed in 1929. As a result of Queen Marie's retirement, Princess Olga assumed the role of first lady in practice.
          </p>
        <p>Princess Olga wore her Diamond Kokoshnik for numerous official pictures and significant international events, including the Coronation ball of George VI, in addition to her Boucheron Tiara and her Ruby Olive Wreath Parure.
          </p>
        <p>Prince Paul and Princess Olga fled Yugoslavia in 1945 and went into exile, but because Olga was closely related to other European royals who were still in power, the tiara was nevertheless visible at significant occasions. At her son's 1955 nuptials to the Italian Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, Princess Olga wore her kokoshnik.
          </p>
        <p>Princess Olga was photographed wearing this tiara during the Pre-Wedding Gala for the 1962 wedding of Princess Sofia to Juan Carlos, although there looked to be visible gaps in the center. Some people were led to believe that the central hanging diamonds had been sold to pay for the family's support while they were in exile because of this. However…
          </p>
        <p>Again, Beth at the History of Famous Jewels and Collections Message Board is to credit for this information; it appears that the tiara had only been modified to raise the top portion.
          In keeping with family custom, Princess Olga gave her new daughter-in-law the tiara (or at the very least, let her borrow it). Its current location is unclear.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Sapphire Wave Tiara</h3>
        <p> When it comes to the Romanov crown jewels, there is a lot of mystery. But it stands to reason that we have long been aware of all of those mysteries. But in 2012, a brand-new puzzle was revealed. Several long-forgotten Romanov Jewels, including the Sapphire Wave Tiara, a magnificent diadem.
          </p>
          <p><img src="rimages/saphwavetiara.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt= "saph wave tiara" style="float:left;width:350px;height:220px;">
              </p>
        <p>Let us begin the mystery's story at the very beginning. He was a mineralist and gemologist by the name of George F. Kunz, and it is in his honor that the gemstone "Kunzite" bears his name. George worked for the United States Geological Survey, an organization, when he passed away in 1932. At the age of 23, he also held a vice president position at Tiffany & Co. The secret was hidden away for many years in the USGS library in Reston, Virginia.
          </p>
        <p> However, it was found in George's bequeathed papers in 2012 that there was a 1922 publication called The Russian Diamond Fund. Outside of being a book, the Russian Diamond Fund is a Kremlin-run institution that holds the remaining Russian Crown Jewels. But in 1922, not long after the last Tzar and his family had been killed by the Bolsheviks, the Diamond Fund was brimming with Romanov artifacts. And this publication has information about them. Interestingly, they were not included in Russia's Treasure of Diamonds and Precious Stones, a 1925 book that was thought to have the most thorough catalog of the Romanov Crown Jewels. Before now.
          </p>
        <p>The Russian Diamond Fund was one of Kunz's copies, and inside it, researchers found four jewelry items that had never been published before. A sapphire bow brooch, an emerald and diamond necklace, a sapphire and diamond bracelet, and The Sapphire Wave Tiara. The tiara included nine seemingly impossibly huge sapphires that were encircled by wave-like diamond loops that each ended in diamond drops. It was so peculiar that some may even argue the tiara had an oceanic feel to it. The tiara was recognized as having belonged to Marie Feodorovna, who you may recall as Alexander III's wife and the mother of the last Tzar of Russia, in a drawing in Geoffrey Munn's book Tiaras: A History of Splendor.
          </p>
          <figure class="figure">

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Maria Feodorovna wearing the Sapphire Wave Tiara in the Kokoshnik style.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        <p>The tiara was commonly worn backed by a traditional kokoshnik headpiece covered in cloth and capped with a row of diamonds (possibly from a diamond rivière necklace). The painting to the right depicts an example of how the Tiara was worn by the Russian Imperial family. In addition to appearing in Konstantin Makovsky's photograph, Marie wore the tiara to the wedding of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia in 1874. However, it remains a mystery as to where the tiara might be right now. The USGS research team was able to ascertain that the tiara and other diamonds, excluding the brooch, were lost to history after being sold at auction in 1927. They could have been disassembled, sold, and used to make other pieces by the Bolsheviks a long time ago.
